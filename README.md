# SpringCloud-Services

• This application is based on **microservices**, it applies different technologies to work well, fast and efficient.

• I implemented **Eureka** to interconnect the microservices into themselves.

• I applied Ribbon for **Load Balancer**, then Ribbon was in the Services I used.

• I put **Feign, RestTemplate** into practice for consuming an API.

• I added a new microservice which is **Commons** for using the same Entity Model in two diffent microservices.

• I  utilized a **Gateway**, because for consulting my microservices because I configured them as random ports,
  the Gateways I added were **Zuul and Spring Cloud Gateway.**
